# 🔗 Notion MCP Server Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Installed

I've successfully installed and configured the **official Notion MCP server** for your autonomous agent system:

- ✅ **Official @notionhq/notion-mcp-server** cloned and built locally
- ✅ **MCP server added** to Claude Code configuration as `notion-api`
- ✅ **Ready for integration** with your autonomous agent system

## 🔑 Required: Notion API Token Setup

To complete the integration, you need to:

### 1. Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)
2. Click **"+ New integration"**
3. Give it a name like **"Autonomous Agent System"**
4. Select your workspace
5. Configure capabilities:
   - **Read content** ✅ (required)
   - **Update content** ✅ (recommended for full functionality)
   - **Insert content** ✅ (recommended for creating pages/comments)

### 2. Get Your Integration Token

1. In your integration settings, go to the **"Configuration"** tab
2. Copy the **"Internal Integration Secret"** (starts with `secret_`)

### 3. Grant Access to Your Pages

**Method 1: Via Integration Settings**
1. Go to your integration's **"Access"** tab
2. Click **"Edit access"**
3. Select the pages/databases you want the agent to access

**Method 2: Per Page**
1. Go to any Notion page you want to share
2. Click the **3 dots** menu (⋯)
3. Select **"Connect to integration"**
4. Choose your integration

### 4. Update Your Environment

Add your Notion API token to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Add this to your .env file
```

### 5. Update MCP Configuration

Once you have your token, update the MCP server configuration:

```bash
# Remove current config
claude mcp remove notion-api -s local

# Add with your actual token
claude mcp add-json notion-api '{
  "command": "npx", 
  "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"], 
  "env": {
    "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer secret_your_actual_token_here\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\"}"
  }
}'
```

## 🚀 Integration with Your Autonomous Agent

Once configured, your autonomous agent system will have access to:

### Available Notion Operations:
- **📖 Read pages and databases**
- **✏️ Create and update content**
- **💬 Add comments**
- **🔍 Search across your workspace**
- **📊 Query databases**
- **🔗 Manage page properties**

### Integration Points:
1. **LifeOS Sync**: Your agent can now read/write to your actual Notion workspace
2. **Knowledge Management**: Store and retrieve information from Notion databases
3. **Task Management**: Create and update tasks in your Notion system
4. **Autonomous Documentation**: Agent can document its actions in Notion

## 🎯 Testing the Integration

After setup, test the integration:

```bash
# Test that MCP server is working
claude mcp list

# Your autonomous agent system will now use the real Notion integration:
python3 run.py --mode interactive
```

In interactive mode, try:
- "Show me my Notion pages"
- "Create a new page about today's agent tasks"
- "Update my Knowledge Hub database"

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Read-only option**: For maximum security, only grant "Read content" capability
- **Selective access**: Only connect specific pages/databases your agent needs
- **Monitor usage**: Review what the agent creates/modifies in Notion
- **Token security**: Keep your integration token secure and never commit it to git

## ✅ Next Steps

Your Notion MCP server is ready! The autonomous agent system can now:

1. **Real LifeOS Integration**: Connect to your actual Notion workspace instead of using stubs
2. **Knowledge Hub Operations**: Read/write to your Knowledge database  
3. **Task Automation**: Create and manage tasks automatically
4. **Documentation**: Log agent activities directly in Notion

The integration is now part of your **1-3-1 autonomous multi-LLM agent architecture** and ready for production use! 🎉

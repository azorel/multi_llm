integrate_with_orchestrator()
```

### 3. Access the Dashboard
Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/analytics-dashboard` to view the analytics interface.

## Configuration

### Alert Thresholds
```python
alert_thresholds = {
    'error_rate': 30.0,           # Percentage
    'response_time': 30000.0,     # Milliseconds
    'cost_spike': 5.0,            # Dollar amount spike

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Background Processes
- **Hourly Aggregation** - Summarizes performance data every hour
- **Data Cleanup** - Removes data older than 30 days
- **Alert Processing** - Continuously monitors for performance issues
- **Load Balancing** - Adjusts provider weights every minute

### Database Maintenance
- Automatic index optimization
- Periodic data compression
- Performance metric cleanup
- Alert history management

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints validate input data
- Database operations use parameterized queries
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed
- Provider API keys are not tracked in analytics

## Performance Impact

The analytics system is designed to have minimal impact on agent performance:
- **Async processing** - Metrics collection doesn't block agent execution
- **Efficient storage** - Optimized database schema and indexes
- **Background aggregation** - Heavy processing done in background threads
- **Caching** - Frequently accessed data is cached in memory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Check if SQLite database file is writable
   - Verify disk space availability

2. **Missing Metrics**
   - Ensure orchestrator integration is active
   - Check that agents are properly initialized

3. **Dashboard Not Loading**
   - Verify Flask server is running
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

4. **Alert System Not Working**
   - Confirm alert thresholds are properly configured
   - Check background monitoring thread status

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test performance tracker
python3 agent_performance_monitor.py

# Test orchestration integration
python3 agent_orchestrator_integration.py

# Check database tables
sqlite3 agent_analytics.db ".tables"

# View recent metrics
sqlite3 agent_analytics.db "SELECT * FROM performance_metrics ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

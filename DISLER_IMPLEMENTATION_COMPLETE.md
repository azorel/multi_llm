## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### **Code Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Enhanced Monitoring Loop** (Lines 963-1082)
```python
async def _disler_unified_monitoring_loop(self):
    """Enhanced Disler AI Engineering System with unified monitoring."""
    # Performance tracking for optimization
    cycle_times = []
    cost_tracking = {'total_cost': 0.0, 'cycles': 0}
    
    # Dynamic interval based on performance
    sleep_interval = max(interval, min(30, avg_cycle_time * 2))
```

#### 2. **Cost Tracking Integration** (Lines 1027-1050)
```python
async def _enhanced_disler_monitoring_cycle(self, disler_engine, cost_tracking):
    """Enhanced monitoring cycle with cost tracking and performance optimization."""
    # Update cost tracking and performance optimization
    cost_tracking['cycles'] += 1
    estimated_cycle_cost = 0.001  # Integrated with actual cost tracking
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Recovery System** (Lines 1061-1082)
```python
async def _disler_enhanced_recovery(self, disler_engine):
    """Enhanced recovery using Disler patterns."""
    # Multi-step recovery with Disler database connectivity checks
    # Sophisticated error handling and recovery testing
```

#### 4. **Comprehensive Configuration** (Lines 218-227)
```python
'disler': {
    'enabled': True,
    'cost_optimization': True,
    'voice_commands': True,
    'workflow_orchestration': True,
    'sfa_patterns': True,

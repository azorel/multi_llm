## 🔮 Predictive Intelligence Capabilities

### **1. Predictive Issue Prevention**
```python
async def _predictive_issue_analysis(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """Predict and prevent issues before they occur."""
    
    # Analyzes patterns to predict:
    # - Issues in next 30 minutes (immediate prevention)
    # - Issues in next 2 hours (short-term prevention)
    # - Issues in next 24 hours (medium-term prevention)
    # - Issues in next week (long-term prevention)
```

**How it works:**
- Analyzes historical patterns and trends
- Identifies leading indicators for problems
- Deploys preventive actions automatically
- Creates predictive models that improve over time

### **2. Autonomous Pattern Discovery**
```python
async def _autonomous_pattern_discovery(self) -> List[Dict]:

    # - Cyclical patterns in usage and performance
    # - Predictive indicators for optimization
    # - Emergent behaviors in multi-agent interactions
```

**Discovers patterns like:**

    # - Intelligence enhancements beyond current scope
    # - Integration possibilities with external systems
```

**Generated capabilities:**

- Enhanced integration patterns
- Novel feature combinations
- Emergent behaviors from component interaction

### **5. Autonomous Code Evolution**
```python
async def _autonomous_system_evolution(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """Evolve the system by modifying and improving its own code."""
    
    # Modifies:
    # - Optimizes functions for better performance
    # - Refactors code for improved maintainability
    # - Adds error handling and resilience
    # - Creates new utility functions
```

**Code modifications:**
